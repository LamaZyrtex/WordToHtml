# WordToHtml

A .Net Core web api application. It shows two different ways to convert a word document to clean html:

1. Converting a word document to html by using the Mammoth library.
2. Converting a word-html document (i.e an html-file exported directly from Word) to clean and proper html. The style names from word are preserved and are used as class names.
